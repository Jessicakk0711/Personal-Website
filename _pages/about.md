My name is Jessica Xu and I’m a sophomore at NYU majoring in math and computer science. 

During my past working experience, I have honed both analytical and teamwork skills by working at different firms and organizations. Earlier, I completed internships as an investment banking analyst at Huatai United Securities. I have acquired better accounting and teamwork skills through analyzing companies’ financial statements while interacting with clients and helping colleagues prepare for prospectus for bond offerings. I was then able to apply the analytical skills to my experience as a corporate banking winter analyst and furthered my research skill through my internship at the Bank of China (New York), where I had the opportunity to research the U.S. real estate market and present 2022 real estate market outlook.

In my spare time,I love doing winter sports, like snowboarding and skating, especially pursuing figure skating for many years. The accolades don’t come out all the time, but I do find pleasure in the hard work of figure skating.
