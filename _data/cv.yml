          contents:
            - Developed new casual inference neural networks with Keras to estimate the treatment effects and risk of readmission 
            - Distributed the model on the servers in the High Performance Computing Core of NYU to train in parallel
            - Trained on over 1 million cases and the predicted effects and risks matched ciliniacians expecatation
            - Desinged a website for clinicians with React and deployed the back-end model on AWS SageMaker

    - title: Software Engineer Intern
      company: Tencent Music Entertainment
      year: May 2021 - Nov. 2021
      description:
        - Deployed pre-trained Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model on distributed servers with gRPC that convert audio into recognized words or phonemes with timestamps
        - Developed a feature following Agile Methodology that generated timestamps on each word by aligning ASR results with lyrics, which add timestamps to over 50 million songs in the music library database and made lyrics scroll word by word while displaying on app as the song is playing and benefited over 800 million QQ music users
        - Implemented the HiFi-GAN model with Pytorch to convert the Mel-frequency spectrum to speech audio on the internal server, made the 3000 audiobooks sound more like humans in the blind test of over 100 users
        - Developed an algorithm that adds minion sound effects to the raw sound and deployed it on the back-end server with Spring Boot, which received data from the front-end karaoke app and converted users’ sounds into minions’ sounds

    - title: Software Engineer Intern
      company: DJI Robomaster
      year: Jan. 2019 - Feb. 2019
      description:
        - Led a team of 7 to design, make, code, and test a self-driving robot that could escape a maze with rotational doors
        - Fused the data of NFC sensor, gyroscope, light sensor, and camera for position estimation
        - Designed the navigating algorithms that helped robots to plan a fasted route out with State-Compress DP
